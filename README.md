# LionHeart Fitness

Professional responsive personal website for my client LionHeart Fitness. Visitors can see what services the client offers in a clear and enticing manner.
Visitors can even fill out a contact form which will automatically send to the clients database for easy management.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript,

This was one of my first experiences working with SASS. And im sure it wont be the last.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

I cant wait to revisit this project later on in my career. Part of the contract was routine maintenance and upkeep, so i cant wait to come back and see how much my programming has improved and what changes i can make to even better improve
the work i have started here.

## Lessons Learned:

First paid Client! It was a great first experience in actually dealing with a client, trying to meet their needs and provide the quality of service that they deserve. It was also a great look into how SASS works and how that can help
bring your CSS to the next level.
